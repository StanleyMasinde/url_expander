### WIP: Docs
Coming soon

### ⚠️ Warning
Please do not deploy this in production. I am doing this to practice Rust. This is far from optimal. Maybe in future, I'll delete this paragraph when I get better.
This can easily be be written in Node.js in less than 50 lines. I recoomend that. 

### Is this deployed anywhere? 
Yes is is part of my [Lnky](https://github.com/StanleyMasinde/Lnky) project. This is what's response for expandinf short links like bt.ly.
